We can think of computing probability of an event only if the corresponding experiment is random. 

**What is an random experiment?**
An experiment is something or some action that can be conducted any number of times under the same setup. 
For example : Tossing a coin, throwing a dice.

Experiment with out replacement, which cannot be executed infinite number of times.
An experiment will be random if we known the total number of out comes and that is set often denoted by  $$\Omega$$
In a random experiment the will be known but the outcome that is coming will be unknown with each trail of the experiment. 

**Event** : Any subset of $$\Omega$$ is called an event. 

In case $$\Omega$$ is continous, 
probability = $$\frac{\text{ no. of favorable outcome }}{\text{No. of total event}}= \frac{\infty}{\infty}$$ and $$\infty$$ is not defined.
We cannot calculate probability as the ratio of these two number.

**Probability Measure** : measure can be some which gives an intuitive idea of the relative size or volume of the set of favourable outcome to the size or volume of the total number of outcomes. 

**Mutually exclusive events** Two events are said to be mutually exclusive if the occurence of one of them precludes the occurence of the  other. For example picking a card from a deck, there can be four mutally exclusive events (getting a heart, clubs, diamond, spades)

Now, any subset of $$\Omega$$ can be an event. Therefreo if A is an event $$A^c$$ (wrt $$\Omega$$) is also an event.

If $$A_1, A_2... A_n$$ are events then $$A_1 \cap A_2 \cap ... A_n$$ is also an event. Thus in general we can think of finite or countable union, intersection of events or their complements to be events.
Hence we must assign probability for all the events possible from a random experiment.
